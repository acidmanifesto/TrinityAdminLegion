trinityadmin
============

Trinity Admin v2 is a general interface add-on which will help staff member ingame for trinity core. 

This version now has some small updates here and there to work with 7.3.5 clients

There is a lot of the original functionality that still works, and works well, and there are some that do not.

========== acidmanifesto's notes========
I forked and fixed a default root path issue as it looked in a different folder.
alot of menus do not work, maybe i will look into when time prevails inbetween projects.
but the GM\TELE\Char\char2 tabs work
which includes item search and spawn\quest search and skill searchs.
